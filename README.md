 Whether you're an Amazon Prime subscriber or only subscribe to Prime video on its own, here's how to terminate your service. 

Note: If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, this will cancel your entire Prime plan, not just Prime Video. 

1. Open Amazon in any web browser â€” if you aren't already signed in, do so now.

2. Once signed in, hover your mouse over "Account & Lists" in the top-right. In the drop-down menu, click "Your Prime Membership."

3. Near the top of the page, click "Manage Membership."

4. In the drop-down menu, click "End membership" and then confirm this is what you really want to do. 

5. Amazon will make you go through several pages, where you have to confirm that you want to end your subscription on every page. Be sure to confirm all of them. 

Once you confirm your cancellation, your membership will be ended.
